Seaweeds have many applications across diverse sectors. This is a big part of the reason they are so interesting. Here we list some of those applications and dive into them.


# Phycocolloids
Seaweeds produce a class of compounds known as phycocolloid or hydrocolloids. These substances have a number of interesting biological properties. They collectively form gels or colloidal mixtures with water. 

## Agar

Agar is a phycocolloid derived from select red algae/Rhodophyta. The primary species from which agar is extracted are: *Gelidium*, *Gracilaria* (and the taxonomic derivatives). Agar is composed of roughly two fractions; agarose and agaropectin. 

Agar from *Gelidium* is said to be of higher quality, but due to it slow growth and previous (over) harvesting of productive beds,  much of the worlds agar is now derived from *Gracilaria* (and related species that used to be classified as Gracilaria). Processes such as alkali pre-treatment are used to improve the quality of *Gracilaria* agar, but it is still, to a degree, inferior. 

Agar is used for a number of applications. It is a component of food where it is often used as a binding agent. Its colloidal structure has resulted in it being used as adhesive. It has been employed as a component of shoe shines. It has been used as a clarifier in brewing, binding particulates to fall out of suspension. 

Of particular interest (to this writer at least) is the biotechnological uses of agar. These are likely the highest value (per unit mass) application of agar. It requires the highest grade, bacteriological agar, derived almost exclusively from *Gelidium*. This is used as medium on agar plates, where bacteria and microbes are grown. It is then a foundation of large swaths of the biotech industry. The agarose fraction commands a value as the medium for gel electrophoresis.

### Extraction
Agar is generally extracted via hot water extraction. One of Agar's unique properties is "hysteresis." When forming a gel, there is a gap between its freezing and melting point(which are normally the same thing).  

#### Standard Method

The so called standard method of extraction goes as follows:
1. Dried and cleaned seaweed is obtained
2. Pretreatment is carried out if needed
	1. 5% alkali is common
	2. Rinse until pH is 5
3. Place seaweed in water, roughly 1:20 seaweed to solvent ratio
4. Boil at 95 c cfor 4-6 hrs
5. Filter via muslin cloth or filter paper while hot
6. Allow filtrate to cool to room temperature and gel
7. Freeze overnight
8. Freeze thaw to remove any excess water. This step can be repeated
9. Cut, grind, package as needed

#### Other methods

A number of so called green technologies have been employed to enhance the efficiency of the agar extraction (whether time, energy, waste production, whatever). These include sonification, Microwave aided extraction, high pressure extraction and many more. I’ll be real a lot of them seem a lot beyond my current resources and understanding. But the study above gives a nice High pressure extraction that should be useful

  
See a high pressure extraction method from (Gomez Barrio et al. 2023)
1. 100g Gelidium was sun dried and washed with freshwater
2. The material, once no sound was found in the washing, was oven dried overnight at 60c
3. The resulting material was milled and ground down to ~1mm particle size
4. 15g of sample was stirred in 450ml 0.5%v/v citric acid for 1hr at room temperature
5. The resulting mixture was filtered with muslin cloth and rinsed with 1L freshwater/distilled till pH was ~5.
6. Samples were placed in 450ml of water for the various autoclave trials. The best treatments were 15 min & 20 min at 120c 
7. Autoclaved samples were filtered hot to prevent gelation.
8. The filtered extract was cooled to room temperature.
9. The resulting gel was frozen overnight and then freeze dried

  

Yields approximately 30% which is on the higher average end of yields (18-35%) Nevertheless, the citric acid pre-treatment followed by a milder extraction conditions (20 min, 110 °C), which reported a 31.69 ± 3.5% yield, had a higher gel strength 183.78 ± 36.80 g cm−2 compared to 110.03 ± 30.51 g cm−2 of the highest yield.



## Carrageenan

Carrageenan is another popular phycocolloid extracted from red algae. It is extracted primarily from *Kappaphycus*, *Euchuema*. The two were both originally classified as *Eucheuma* before those damned taxonomy changes.

Carrageenan is more commonly used in food. It is especially used in diary as an emulsifier to add thickness, creaminess and texture. In fact, look at the next ""milky"" product and you may find carrageenan. 



#### Standard Methods

Carrageenan is extracted from Euchuema, Kappaphycus and Soliera. The process is another alkaline hydrolysis. 

  

1. Seaweed is soaked in alkali and water overnight (0.15%)
2. Seaweed is washed until neutral ph
3. Seaweed is boiled at 90-100c for 2 hours at a ratio of 20L/kg seaweed
4. Seaweed is filtered hot
5. Filtrate is left with 0.2% KCl for 30min for precipitation
6. Dry (eg, oven 60c for 2 days)
7. Grind to powder
