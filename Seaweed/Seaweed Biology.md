This Page has info on the biology of seaweeds. Now this is super diverse, and in all honesty, will probably ennd up as several files. But for now? I'll work here.


Seaweeds are algae (let's say plantlike organisms) with *at least* one macroscopic (or visible to the naked eye) lifestage. There are seaweeds which are large enough to be visible to the naked eye effectively all their lives. And there are those with life stages you cannot see without a microscope. 

They are found (mostly) in marine(sea/ocean) waters, but there are some freshwater examples. They are found from the rocky shores down to several hundred feet deep. They range from tiny enough to fit in a palm (with room to spare!) like *Ventricaria ventricosa* to taller than your average person like *Saccharina latissima*.  


## Groups of Seaweeds
Seaweeds (or macroalgae) are generally grouped into 3 groups. These are **mostly** based on the colour of the seaweed:

+ Green Algae (Chlorophyta)
+ Red Algae (Rhodophyta)
+ Brown Algae (Oochromophyta, You'll also see Phaeophyta, they changed the name...they do that a lot)

I say mostly because seaweeds are weird. That will be a recurring theme. Some change colour, actually a lot will under the right light and nutrients. Red, green and brown are good guidelines, but it is far from fool proof.



## Seaweeds are not *Technically* plants

Seaweeds behave a whole lot like plants. Well, since (land/true/higher) plants are descended from green algae, its more accurate to say plants behave a whole lot like seaweed. They are both photosynthetic, converting light and nutrients into a form living creatures can use. 

That said, seaweed are generally a lot simpler. Living in water they have no need for complex transport systems (they can take nutrients in the water across their whole body surface.) They need no support tissue to stand upright and resist gravity. They need no special adaptations to reduce water loss. As a result, they lack most of that "unproductive tissue" and channel most of it into growth. And by God, they grow fast compared to most land plants. 

## Seaweed Nutrient Needs

Seaweeds take up their nutrients across most of their surface as they are suspended in water with dissolved nutrients. Because of this they do not "need" roots. What they have instead are holdfasts, which only attach them to the substrate (whatever they grow on). These substances can be taken up in a couple ways:
1. Diffusion:
2. Facilitated Diffusion:
3. Active transport:

Which way is used depends on the nature of the nutrient (polarity/charge), concentration gradients, the type of seaweed, and even external conditions. Generally though, larger substances are taken by diffusion. Charged substances are taken via facilitated diffusion and active transport

Seaweeds require much of the nutrients that land plants do. Most of the elements in natural seawater are required some degree. That said, some are only needed in trace amounts, others are needed far more.
