As a result of its many [[Seaweed Application]], seaweed is actively cultivated, these notes go here.


# General Principles





# Mariculture/In Situ Cultivation
## Tropical Seaweeds

There are at present (2025), only two genera of tropical seaweed cultivated at scale. *Gracilaria* and *Euchuema*/*Kappaphycus*. Both are cultivated in similar methods at sea.

(Other genera exist but are cultivated far, far, far less)



A rope (often supported by another structure) is set up at sea in a suitable site. Fragments of the target seaweed are attached to the rope. This may take the form of being tied on to a secondary rope attached to the mainline, or being directly braided into the structure of the main rope.

The seaweed is then allowed to grow, pulling nutrients from the water column. In roughly 60 days (Depending on species, location, season ect). The seaweed has grown to size. It can then be removed from the line and harvested. As the seaweed has the ability to regenerate, a portion of the harvest is often used to re-seed the farm. 

The rope may be stretched between stakes embedded in the seafloor. This method is popular, and does not require as much resources, but it does need an appropriate depth and bottom type. Alternatively the line can be attached to a bouyant structure and floated near the surface. This includes cages, framed, or actual floats (or makeshift floats like bottles.) These methods float and so rise and fall with the tides. They can potentially be used in deeper water.
